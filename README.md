# personal-bio-site

## Description 
The purpose of this site is to display information about me (Joey Petrone) pertaining to my journey through the Nashville Software School Fullstack Bootcamp (C#, .Net). This site will display a page that shows my Bio, Technologies learned, Projects, and Contact information. I expect this site to go through many phases as I progress through this course, but genereally it should stay fairly simple and easy to navigate.
